    "The min-conflicts algorithm is a search method for solving constraint satisfaction problems.

    "For each computer science course, the function calls the min_conflicts_value function, which in turn calls the argmin_random_tie function.  The domain of the variable gets passed into argmin_random_tie, which is 3 classrooms * 8 times=24 total options for each course.  \n",
    "argmin_random_tie iterates through the domain of each course variable to determine which room/time combination has the least amount of conflicts.  To do this, it iterates through each room/time combo in the list and calls the nconflicts function.  The nconflicts function returns a 1 if the course/room/time combo has a conflict with another course/room/time combo in its domain list.  From here, it counts the number of 1's in the list and returns this value to argmin_random_tie.  argmin_random_tie keeps a variable of the lowest number of conflicts retrieved from nconflicts for each tuple in the list and sets the best tuple value based on its nconflicts value.  If there is a tie for lowest number of conflicts, it selects a random tuple value. From here, argmin_min_random_tie returns a tuple value to min_conflicts. \n",
    "After this, min_conflicts iterates through for max_steps and finds a list of variables in the solution dictionary that are conflicted.  It takes a random variable from the list of conflicted variables, finds the variables value that has the lowest number of conflicts, and sets a new value equal to the value with the lowest number of conflicts.  It does this until either max_steps are reached or it has a dictionary with no conflicts.  From here, it returns the solution and the number of steps it took.  "

    "A big part of this assignment was setting up the data correctly to pass into the already defined min_conflicts function.  To do this, I first iterated through each of the 3 lists: classes times, and rooms.  In this nested for loop, I add each class to a dictionary as the key if it doesn't exist.  For the value, I add a tuple in the form (classroom, time).  When the course key already exists, I append another tuple to the value with the new classroom and time. So the end variable is a dictionary with courses as the keys with lists of tuples that have classrooms and times.  Next, I get the neighbors of each class.  The neighbors for each course are simply the other courses.   Finally, I return the min_conflicts function with its results to get a schedule with steps.  \n",

Next, I check whether the compared classes have the same time and same room, if they do return false.  Finally I compare the keys third index, which is the level of the course.  I get the third character in the key, and if the two are the same, and they have the same time, I will return false.  The one exception here is that I check if the classes are 163 and 164, and if they are I return true because this is ok.  \n",

From here, all I needed to do was iterate through the solution dictionary and find the tuple value in the pandas table using the pandas .loc[] method and setting the cell to the dictionary key (class).
