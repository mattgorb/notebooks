Hi Chuck, 

Is there any way you can provide the grader file for the neural network homework?  All of my code ran correctly on the provided grader file, but I used a global variable which I think screwed things up on your grader file which lost me 40 points.  This is really unfortunate for me since neural networks are my strong suit and I thought this would be a sure 100%.  

Thanks,
Matt Gorbett
